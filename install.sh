### redis recommended
I set it up very easily.
1. Ensure Redis is up and running
2. Enable Redis via the WordPress plugin, only setting I had to change was password because I use requirepass
Additionally, I’d recommend these settings in redis.conf:
maxmemory 100mb maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru maxmemory-samples 10 appendonly yes
and disable snapshotting, comment out the lines beginning with “save” to do this, for example,
#save 900 1 #save 300 10 #save 60 10000
I’d also add vm.overcommit_memory = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf.
Also disable transparent huge pages, echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

### MEMCACHE
What you should know is that LiteSpeed ​​has its own Memcached server which is optimized

Before starting the installation, test using the telnet command if Memecached is installed and functional:

telnet 127.0.0.1 11211
If the return of the command is telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused, it means that the Memcached server is not available.

Install dependencies:

sudo apt-get install git build-essential zlib1g-dev libexpat1-dev openssl libssl-dev libsasl2-dev libpcre3-dev -y
Download LiteSpeed ​​Memcached:

sudo wget https://github.com/litespeedtech/lsmcd/archive/master.zip
Unzip the archive:

sudo unzip master.zip
Go to the sources folder:

cd lsmcd-master
Prepare, compile and install LSMCD using the following commands:

sudo./fixtimestamp.sh
sudo./configure CFLAGS=" -O3" CXXFLAGS=" -O3"
sudo make
sudo make install
Start the service:

sudo systemctl start lsmcd
Activate automatic start:

sudo systemctl enable lsmcd
Check the service:

sudo systemctl status lsmcd.service
You can also re-test with telnet.


### redis setup
I set it up very easily.

Ensure Redis is up and running
Enable Redis via the WordPress plugin, only setting I had to change was password because I use requirepass
Additionally, I’d recommend these settings in redis.conf:

maxmemory 100mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
maxmemory-samples 10
appendonly yes

and disable snapshotting, comment out the lines beginning with “save” to do this, for example,

#save 900 1
#save 300 10
#save 60 10000

I’d also add vm.overcommit_memory = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf.

Also disable transparent huge pages,
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

### edit /etc/redis/redis.conf
# create a unix domain socket to listen on
unixsocket /run/redis/redis.sock
# set permissions for the socket
unixsocketperm 775
#requirepass passwordtouse
#bind 127.0.0.1
daemonize yes
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error no
rdbcompression yes
# maximum memory allowed for redis
maxmemory 50M
# how redis will evice old objects - least recently used
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
